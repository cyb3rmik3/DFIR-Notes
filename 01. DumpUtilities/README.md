This utility is used to generate a physical memory dump of Windows machines. It works with both x86 (32-bits) and x64 (64-bits) machines.
The raw memory dump is generated in the current directory, only a confirmation question is prompted before starting.
Perfect to deploy the executable on USB keys, for quick incident responses needs.
